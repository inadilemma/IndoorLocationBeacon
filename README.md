IndoorLocationBeacon
====================

This is a research demo for indoor location tracking using iBeacon in iOS. Three or more iBeacon anchor nodes are used as reference nodes whose beacon IDs and reference locations will be known to the app and the using the reference locations, the app can triangulate it's current location with respect to the anchors. This location information can be sent to remote webservice or a central controller unit within the home WLAN.
